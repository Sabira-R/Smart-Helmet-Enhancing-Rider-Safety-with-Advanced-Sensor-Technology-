# Smart-Helmet-Enhancing-Rider-Safety-with-Advanced-Sensor-Technology-

Smart Helmet is an IoT-based rider safety system designed to enhance two-wheeler safety through real-time monitoring, accident detection, and emergency alerting. The system integrates multiple sensors—including impact collision, vibration, ultrasonic, infrared (IR), and alcohol gas sensors—connected to an Arduino UNO microcontroller. When an accident or risky condition is detected, the system automatically sends SMS alerts with the rider’s location to pre-saved contacts via a GSM module.

Additional features include helmet-wear detection, collision warnings, sleep/drowsiness detection, alcohol detection, and a manual SOS button for emergencies. By combining preventive safety measures with automated alerting, the project demonstrates practical applications of embedded systems, sensor interfacing (UART, I2C), and IoT communication.

**Key Features**

Accident Detection: Impact and vibration sensors trigger emergency alerts upon detecting collisions.

Emergency SMS Alerts: GSM module sends location-based alerts to pre-saved contacts.

Helmet Compliance Monitoring: Ensures riders wear helmets; can act as an anti-theft mechanism.

Alcohol Detection: MQ-3 gas sensor prevents the bike from starting if intoxication is detected.

Collision Warning: Ultrasonic sensors provide proximity alerts to prevent accidents.

Sleep/Drowsiness Detection: IR sensors detect rider fatigue and trigger an alert buzzer.

Manual SOS Alerts: Push button allows riders to send emergency messages manually.
